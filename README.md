# Proxies

This repository is configured to track only files in the repository root. All subfolders and their contents are ignored by `.gitignore` so you can keep large or generated folder trees out of Git while tracking root-level files.

If you want to include specific subfolders later, tell me which ones and I'll update `.gitignore` accordingly.
